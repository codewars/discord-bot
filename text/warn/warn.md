You are receiving this message because you have broken some rules or are on the verge of doing so.

While we welcome everyone with open arms and discussions of all sorts whether related to Codewars or not, we ask that you adhere to a few basic rules:

- Do not use this server to promote your own products and/or services
- Do not abuse this server for free help on your programming assignments, homework, exercise, etc. Asking for help and guidance once in a while is fine; expecting to be spoonfed every single time and draining everyone else's energy is not
- Do not post content which may not be deemed appropriate for a particular age range. This includes, but is not limited to: nudity, violence, racial / gender discrimination, "edgy" memes which may be morally questionable

Consider this a formal warning. If you insist on engaging in such behavior, we reserve the right to kick or ban you from the server indefinitely, and your Codewars account (if any) may be restricted.
