You've been found repeatedly asking for free help on tasks unrelated to Codewars.

While we welcome everyone with open arms and would happily entertain the _occasional_ request for help and guidance on programming outside of Codewars, expecting to be spoonfed every single time and draining everyone else's energy is not.

If you insist on engaging in such behavior, we reserve the right to kick or ban you from the server indefinitely, and your Codewars account (if any) may be restricted. You've been warned.
