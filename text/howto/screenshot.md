# How to post screenshots

- Please visit [Screenshot Help](https://screenshot.help) for info how to make screenshots on different platforms, devices, and OSes.
- Please do not post screenshots of code: code snippets shared by you should be easy to copy from Discord, paste into Codewars trainer or local IDE, and run.
- It's OK to post screenshots to show output of tests, problems with editor, etc.
- It's absolutely not OK to post photos of your screen made with your phone instead of screenshots.
