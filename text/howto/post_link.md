# How to post links to kata

- Surround the links to kata with angle brackets: `<https://www.codewars.com/kata/50654ddff44f800200000004/python>`. This will prevent Discord from inserting embeds into your message, as they do not carry too much useful information, and are quite annoying.
- Please, do _NOT_  post direct links to kata trainers: make sure you don't have a trailling ~~`/trainer`~~ in the url.
- Remember to also mention a title of the kata you are linking to.
