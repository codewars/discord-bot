# How to use code formatting in Discord messages

Discord supports Markdown for code blocks and syntax highlighting of various programming languages.
If you want to post code and use syntax highlighting, you need to surround it with three backticks,
with an optional name of your language:

\`\`\`python  
def hello_world():  
  print("Hello, world!")  
\`\`\`

When you do this, your code will be neatly formatted:

```python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

You can replace `python` with any other language supported by Discord, or just omit it.
