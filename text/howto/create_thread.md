# How to create Discord threads

Please use Discord threads to keep discussions focused, avoid spoilers, and to not introduce unnecessary noise into main channels. Remember to give a meaningful title to your thread, for example _"hobovsky - help with Multiply"_, or just _"hobovsky - Multiply"_, and continue your discussion in the thread.

See Discord docs if you do not know how to create threads: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ#h_01GDXVYE6AZA3QRSB42F5AGGYG>
