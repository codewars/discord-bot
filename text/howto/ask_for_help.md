# How to ask for help

- Ask your question in an appropriate channel. You can use `#help-solve` for a general help with some kata, or topic-specific channels ( `#python`, or `#algorithms` ) if you need help with an algorithm or a syntax of a language.
- Create a thread to keep the discussion focused on your topic (react with :thread: `:thread:` or use `/howto create_thread` for more info).
- Explain what kata you are trying to solve. Post its title, and a link to its description (react with :link: `:link:` or use `/howto kata_link` for more info).
- Explain what your problem is. Tests do not accept your answers? Solution is timing out? Is there some other problem?
- Post **properly formatted** code of your solution (react with :hash: `:hash:` or use `/howto format_code` for more info).
- If the code you posted contains spoilers for the discussed kata, please delete it after discussing your matter and getting all necessary help.
