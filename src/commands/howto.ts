Discord supports Markdown for code blocks and syntax highlighting of various programming languages.
If you want to post code and use syntax highlighting, you need to surround it with three backticks,
with an optional name of your language:

\\\`\\\`\\\`python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
\\\`\\\`\\\`

When you do this, your code will be neatly formatted:

\`\`\`python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

You can replace \`python\` with any other language supported by Discord, or just omit it.

More info in Discord docs: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-#h_01GY0DAKGXDEHE263BCAYEGFJA>.`,

- Ask your question in an appropriate channel. You can use \`#help-solve\` for a general help with some kata, or topic-specific channels ( \`#python\`, or \`#algorithms\` ) if you need help with an algorithm or a syntax of a language.
- Create a thread to keep the discussion focused on your topic (react with :thread: \`:thread:\` or use \`/howto create_thread\` for more info).
- Explain what kata you are trying to solve. Post its title, and a link to its description (react with :link: \`:link:\` or use \`/howto kata_link\` for more info).
- Explain what your problem is. Tests do not accept your answers? Solution is timing out? Is there some other problem?
- Post **properly formatted** code of your solution (react with :hash: \`:hash:\` or use \`/howto format_code\` for more info).
- If the code you posted contains spoilers for the discussed kata, please delete it after discussing your matter and getting all necessary help.
